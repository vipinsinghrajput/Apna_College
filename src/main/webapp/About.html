            <h1>Vipin Rajpoot</h1>
            <p>Hi, first of all, thanks for visiting this page. This page is all about me - Vipin Rajput (Member of
                Apna College). You will get exciting things about my life.</p>
            <h2>About ApnaCollege:</h2>
            <p>Success is all about taking new initiatives. I started developing <b>ApnaCollege</b> in the year 2023. At
                the
                moment, I was providing Collages Infomatino Meanwhile, I thought, why not to spread my knowledge to the
                world. So I started developing ApnaCollege on JavaScript using the Struts 2 framework. At that time
                struts 2 was the leading web framework
                I think every student find to Infomatino at home so i am create a website
            </p>
            <h2>Why I started the ApnaCollege:</h2>

            <p>A lot of students belongs to village and small cities so all college are unable to find because there are
                lack of information about colleges and students do not have time. so create ApnaCollege website whose
                every student help find to information at home .
            </p>
            <h2>Why ApnaCollege Name:</h2>
            <p> I searched a lot of good names on the web, but all were registered. Since I was providing training in
                neha Nagar, indor (Mp/NCR), there was a Apna which was very famous. So I just added Apna
                with Collage and checked on the net if it is registered or not. Thankfully, It was not registered. So, I
                registered this domain. In my opinion, name doesn't matter too much, work matters a lot. I thought, if I
                could work better to the existing site, it will be famous one day. And, thank God, now all the software
                professionals and students know about it.</p>
            <h2>About Me:</h2>
            <p>What to say about myself, I don't know. I am a simple guy from childhood, keen to learn new things and
                implement new ideas. Never worried about what I don't have. What I have is the best thing.</p>
            <p>I was born in Budwar, Gaisabad Hatta, Damoh ,Mp, India. It is near to Dimond city Panna. Currently, I am
                living in Sagar , Mp.</p>
            <h2>Sports:</h2>
            <p>If you play sports, you fail sometimes, and it teaches you keep going. In childhood, I was enjoying
                playing games like Flying kite, Gilli Danda, Badminton, Ludo and marble
                (kancha). Later on I started playing Cricket, I played cricket to District Level, I played too many
                tournaments, and host one tournament also. After the 12th, I left everything, because I was out of home.
                It was not the metro city, so there was the limited scope and family was not supporting the Cricket so I
                became the career-oriented guy.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Interest in Computer:</h2>
            <p>After completed 12th ,I asked my parents go to indore for preparation Govt. exam , so my parents
                suggested in domoh but i am not interest in stuty in damoh so i meet in sagar collage sir , he talk me
                and understant in technical field so after listing i am interest in technical field after that i am
                invite to my home so he came my home and meet my parents so sir tell techinical field my parents so my
                parents also interest and i am decided i go in techinical field in cs branch and take admission b.tech
                in cs branch after that my interest increse in Computer .
            </p>
            <h2>Failures:</h2>
            <p>You can't get success without failures. After doing the 10th, I was not able to crack the Nda exam of
                a upsc. After doing the 11th, I failed in the entrance exam of JEE. It happened because I was weak in
                General Knowledge and mathemamtics at that time. But, I was the master of my subject.</p>
            <h2>Struggle:</h2>
            <p>You can't get success without struggle, determination, hard work and decision-making ability. I don't
                want to specify my struggle here because, in the end, result matters.</p>

            <h2>Future Aspect:</h2>
            <p>I always think: "It's just a beginning". I have to achieve more. I want to see my growth endless. It's
                not my dream to touch the sky, I want to go beyond the sky. Finally, I would like to say, It's just the
                beginning.</p>
            <h2>Belief in God:</h2>
            <p>I have a strong belief in the existence of God. I think we are made of energy. One day, we will lose our
                energy (Aatma in Hindi), and it will go to the God again (Parmatma in Hindi).</p>
            <h2>About Success:</h2>
            <p>Everybody has different thoughts on Success. What are the key points to get successful? Luck! May be but
                not all the time. There are a lot of factors that makes a person successful: positive thinking nature,
                your goal: you must know what do you have to do in life, decision-making ability, your working nature in
                setback and failures, time management: what are you doing now and what will you do in future, ready to
                take risks, and innovative ideas.</p>
            <br>
            <i>Being ideal defines your success.</i>
            <h2>At the end:</h2>
            <p>Death is the bitter truth of life and it is the universal truth. But, before this, I have to do something
                inspiring, and be an ideal.</p>
            <h2>Be My Friend:</h2>
            <p>I always like to make new friends. Follow me on LinkedIn, Facebook or Instagram and be connected.</p>
